# Hey, I'm Josh Lopez, Your Mortgage Guy with a Competitive Edge!

What’s up? I’m Josh Lopez, a Mortgage Loan Officer here in sunny California since 2021. Think of me as your guide through the wild world of home loans—whether you’re looking at an FHA loan to get your foot in the door or a Conventional loan to lock in that dream home. I’m always just a phone call away to help make it happen!

## A bit about me:

I was born and raised in Los Angeles, and as a former D3 collegiate swimmer, I’m all about tackling challenges head-on. These days, I also train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai—so whether I’m helping you finance your home or on the mats, I’m bringing my A-game every time. My job is kind of like martial arts—I’m here to help you maneuver smoothly through the mortgage process, no matter how tough the situation gets!

## Creative Solutions for My Clients

One thing I love is finding creative solutions for my clients. Just the other day, I had a borrower who really wanted to buy a house but had almost no down payment. Most people would’ve thought it was a dead end, but not me! I dug deep and found a Down Payment Assistance Loan that gave them a 5% down payment as a repayable second mortgage. With that, they were able to get their home and kick off their homeownership journey.

## Outside the Office

When I’m not busy crunching numbers or finding loan solutions, I’m either hitting the mats for BJJ or Muay Thai or relaxing with family and friends. My dedication to my clients is the same as my dedication to training—100% all in.
