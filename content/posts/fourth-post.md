# Why You Shouldn’t Open New Credit Accounts During the Mortgage Process

Congratulations! You’ve found your dream home and are well on your way to closing your mortgage loan. But hold on—before you go celebrating by opening a shiny new credit card or financing that dream car, let’s talk about why this can be a disastrous move for your loan approval.

## The Bank's Final Credit Check: A Reality Check

Here’s something most borrowers don’t realize: **just before the bank funds your loan, they usually perform a soft pull on your credit.** This is done to ensure there are no surprises—like new accounts, loans, or increased debt obligations—that might affect your ability to qualify.

If the bank discovers new credit accounts or a spike in your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, a few things could happen:
- **Delays in funding:** The bank might need time to reevaluate your financial situation.
- **Loan denial:** In some cases, the new debt could make you ineligible for the loan.
- **Revised terms:** If you still qualify but with higher risk, you could face less favorable terms or higher interest rates.

## Tips to Stay on Track

To ensure a smooth closing process, follow these golden rules:

### 1. **Hold Off on Big Purchases**
That new car or designer furniture can wait. Financing large purchases increases your debt and DTI ratio, which lenders closely scrutinize during the final credit check.

### 2. **Avoid New Credit Accounts**
Even if a store offers a tempting discount for opening a card, resist the urge. A new credit inquiry and account can temporarily lower your credit score and raise red flags for lenders.

### 3. **Stay on Top of Your Existing Accounts**
Keep paying your bills on time and avoid maxing out your current credit cards. Maintaining stability is key.

### 4. **Communicate With Your Loan Officer**
Planning a financial change? Always consult with your loan officer first. They can guide you on whether it’s a good idea or how to minimize the impact.

## Real-Life Example: A Deal Almost Gone Wrong

I recently worked with a borrower who was all set to close on their dream home. Everything looked perfect—until the bank’s final credit check revealed they’d opened a new credit card to “save money” on furniture. That small decision bumped up their DTI ratio, delaying the process by two weeks and almost costing them the home.

We managed to work it out, but it was a stressful situation for everyone involved. The lesson? Keep things simple and avoid financial changes during the mortgage process.

## My Recommendations

1. **Stick to your budget:** Avoid overextending yourself financially, even if you think the change won’t matter.
2. **Be transparent:** Share any financial changes with your loan officer immediately.
3. **Remember the finish line:** The goal is to close on your home. Short-term sacrifices can prevent long-term regrets.

Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll make. Keeping your finances stable during the mortgage process isn’t just smart—it’s essential. So, put off that new car, credit card, or furniture purchase until you’re holding the keys to your new home.
