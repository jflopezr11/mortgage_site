## 🏡 JoshuaLopezLoans.com — The Ultimate Mortgage Hub 🏡
Welcome to the world of JoshuaLopezLoans.com, where mortgages aren't just serious business, they’re also kinda fun (well, we try). This is your go-to site for everything mortgage-related, packed with tools, resources, and a sprinkle of cheeky humor. I built this from the ground up, and yes, the Mortgage Calculator is my favorite child. Let’s dive in:


## 🚀 Summary:
This website is for people who want to understand mortgages and for those who might fall asleep when thinking about interest rates. Fear not, because I’ve got your back. From a blog that breaks down the confusing parts of home buying to the almighty Mortgage Calculator, this site has it all.

## 🎉 Features I’m Proud of (a.k.a. Why You’ll Love It)
🔢 The Mortgage Calculator (It’s Kinda My Baby)
You know that moment when you’re trying to figure out how much home you can actually afford, and then your brain freezes? Well, not anymore!
With the Mortgage Calculator, you can plug in a few numbers (purchase price, interest rate, etc.) and watch the magic happen.
Why did I build it? Because navigating mortgages shouldn’t feel like solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded. This calculator breaks it down with easy-to-digest monthly payment breakdowns and an interactive amortization schedule.

## 📝 The Blog
Not everyone loves reading about mortgages, but here you’ll find articles that don’t suck. From "How to Qualify for a QM Loan" to "How Brazilian Jiu Jitsu relates to Mortgages", I’ve got something for everyone.
It’s simple, informative, and won’t bore you to death.

## 🌟 Why This Site Matters:
The home-buying process is hard enough. Between understanding loans, calculating payments, and balancing life, you don’t need a site that makes things even more complicated. This is why JoshuaLopezLoans.com exists: to make things clear, simple, and maybe a little bit fun (but not too much—we’re still talking about mortgages).

## 🤷‍♂️ Why Did I Build This?
Well, I’m glad you asked. Here’s the brutally honest truth: I built this because I’m a failed software engineer. Yep, I said it. I can’t solve a LeetCode problem fast enough to save my life, I break out in a sweat just thinking about a whiteboard interview, and honestly, the idea of telling people that I still code makes me want to crawl under a rock. But hey, here we are!

This project is part of my business as a Mortgage Loan Officer, but more importantly, it’s my personal redemption arc. You see, while I’m building out JoshuaLopezLoans.com, I’m also building out my confidence in coding (and life, really). And with the magical assistance of ChatGPT when I inevitably break something (which happens more than I care to admit), I’m starting to believe that maybe—just maybe—I can actually pull this off.

So yeah, this site isn’t just about mortgages. It’s about proving to myself (and maybe to you, dear reader) that I can still code, and maybe one day, I’ll tackle that LeetCode question without breaking into a cold sweat. Until then, this site is my playground and learning ground—every line of code gets me one step closer to not being terrified of coding interviews. Here’s to progress, no matter how slow it might be.

## 🔮 Future Features (Because I’m Always Improving, Obviously)

User Dashboard: A place for clients to save their calculations and return for later tweaks. Let’s save you from re-entering numbers every time.

Loan Program Comparison Tool: You’ll be able to easily compare FHA, VA, Conventional, and other loans like you’re picking between pizza toppings.

## 💡 Technologies Used:
Next.js: For all the awesome server-side rendering and frontend goodness.
React: Because building interactive UI is a breeze with it.
Tailwind CSS: To make the site look clean and modern with minimal effort.
Chart.js: So you can enjoy the sweet, sweet mortgage data visualizations.
HubSpot API: For getting in touch, because who doesn’t love a smooth contact form?
Vercel: Because this site’s fast and secure, and I like my sites like I like my coffee—strong and reliable.

## 👀 Want to Peek at the Code?
Feel free to dig into the code, and remember to be gentle—it’s been through a lot (I may or may not have refactored it too many times). You’ll find all the features mentioned above and maybe some hidden gems.
